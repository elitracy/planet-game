Background Events
 - too little food
     - draught
     - storms

 - too little energy
    - can't build more houses for people
    - people get unhappy


Left Off:
- ticking planet.go system
- how do we want to do actions? 
    - should this be a gamestate handled thing?
    - references to current actions are appended to a game state array and updated there
- should I do a similar thing with orders?
    - will looping thorough all planets be bad
    - should an order queue just be a part of the player game state? 
        - a reference to the entity already exists so we know what to update
